# Studious-parakeet

DockerHub registry: https://cloud.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/galrito/coinlite

## Getting Started

1. Clone repo and cd into it
2. Make sure docker and kubernetes are installed and running
	1. minikube -p test start 
3. Build docket instance: docker built -t coinlite:latest .
4. Create service and statefulset: kubectl create -f studiousparakeet.yaml
	1. Monitor progress with: kubectl get pod -w -l  app=coinlite 


## Docker CIS benchmarking
In order to perform the Docker CIS test: bash docker_cis_test.sh




## Working notes

* docker installation
	* https://gist.github.com/levsthings/0a49bfe20b25eeadd61ff0e204f50088
* checksum validation
	* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSHA256SUM
* docker cis controls

*  kubernetes not working (Unable to connect to the server: dial tcp 192.168.99.101:8443: connect: no route to host)
	https://neutrollized.blogspot.com/2018/01/unable-to-connect-to-server-dial-tcp.html
	* removing VPN and restart kubernetes solved it
* useful kubernetes commands

	- source <(kubectl completion zsh)
